# Reusable doors in BIM
In this repository you can find a code for a Blender add-on that automatically creates a digital model of reusable doors from Concular.

The detailed explanaition about the process and the creation of this add-on is documented in the thesis. 

In the Blender file is the running add-on and in the .txt file is the entire script for it as well. 
The code can be executed right away in Blenders scripting environment. To generate a door model, simply insert the Concular-URL in the add-on and press the "Add"-button. 
The add-on can be modified in the code in Blender's scripting environment. 
Please note, that this project is a prototype and does not work for all doors in Concular.
